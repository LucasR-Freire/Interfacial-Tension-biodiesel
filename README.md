# Interfacial Tension Biodiesel

During the transesterification step of biodiesel production, chemical reactions occur between the triglyceride and methanol. These reactions occur during the flow of reactants, and there is a difficulty in predicting the type of two-phase flow, a factor that alters the efficiency of the reaction. In order to predict the flow, the capillary number of each fluid, which depends on the surface tension, is necessary. Since the surface tension values between the reactants are not available in the literature, it is necessary to measure them in the laboratory. The purpose of this work is to build an equipment that can measure the surface tension between 2 liquids, and evaluate if the tension changes during the reaction. 
Among all the available methods for measuring surface tension, the drop method was chosen, because it obtains the tension values in time. In summary, the experiment consists of filming a drop of one liquid suspended in a reservoir containing the other liquid, and capturing the geometrical properties of the drop. After capturing and extracting the outline of the droplet, the Bashforth and Adams differential equation is used. Although it has no analytical solution, we can, through an iterative method, create several droplet profiles that approximate the experimental profile. When we find the experimental droplet profile through the equation, the surface tension value is quickly calculated.
